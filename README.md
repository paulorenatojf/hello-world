# hello-world

Hi people of the world!

My name is Paulo, and i was born in the beautiful Madeira Island,Portugal. I'm currently travelling and working in Brazil.
I'm a self taught designer with an appetite for machines.

I first learned Javascript, liked it, jumped to Jquery and now gonna make a try at PHP.
My aim is to be self sufficient at developing sites and web apps from scratch.

See you there... go!
